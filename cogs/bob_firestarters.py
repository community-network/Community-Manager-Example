                Click the emoji attached to this message to get notified when we're going to start the servers. It will give you the Firestarter role, we will ping that role every time we start our servers. You will receive VIP access to one of the servers of your choice as a thank you for helping us launch our servers.

                **how does seeding work:**
                We need 20 people (for a 64 player conquest server) in a server before you can actually play in the server, by joining the server with the rest of the people here the server will get to that magic number and start the game.

                *to remove the role: click on the emoji to remove your reaction*"""
